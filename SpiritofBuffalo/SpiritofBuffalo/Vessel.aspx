    <p class="noTopPad"><em>Spirit of Buffalo</em> was built by Rover Marine Lines. She sailed her first five seasons in the day sailing 
          trade out of Lewis, Delaware, then transferred to Georgetown, South 
          Carolina in 1997 where she sailed on the Winyah Bay.</p>
          
    <p>In late fall of 2008 she was purchased by Buffalo Sailing Adventures and was brought from South Carolina to Baltimore.  The winter was spent preparing here for her transit up the Hudson and through the Erie Canal to her new home, Buffalo.  She arrived in Buffalo during the first week of May 2009.</p>  
    
    <p>The Spirit has provided many people the opportunity to enjoy and see Buffalo from a differnt perspective...from the water. She can be identified by her tan bark (red) sails.</p>
