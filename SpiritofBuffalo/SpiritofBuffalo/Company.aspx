	<p  class="noTopPad">Buffalo Sailing Adventures is a family owned and operated company established in December of 2008 operating out of Buffalo, New York.  The Spirit of Buffalo is a 73 foot coastal sailing vessel which is the only square rigged, topsail schooner sailing out of the Historic Buffalo Harbor.</p>

        <p>Ric and Kathy Hilliman started their passion for sailing as teenagers.  Weekends were spent at Sherkston Beach, where they rented small sail boats.</p>

        <p>While raising 3 children in Tonawanda their passion continued and they invested in their first sailboat, a hobie cat.  They spent many weekends sailing the Lake Erie, the Kinzua Dam and Allegheny Reservoir with their 3 children. </p> 

        <p>Their next boat was a 32ft sloop which was kept at the Small Boat Harbor. During the summer their evenings and weekends were consumed by the waters of Lake Erie.</p>

        <p>While studying for Ric's captains license, he volunteered on the Buffalo Fire Boat Edward Cotter.  Serving as the captain of the Miss Buffalo, the Lockport Canal Boats and the Moondance were the focus of Ric's summers.</p>

        <p>Later when the children were on their own, 1st Mate Kathy & Ric packed their bags and moved to Key West for a season. They both worked on Schooners similar to the Spirit of Buffalo. That season was the turning point of their lives. They bought Sea Dragon and have been sailing her during the winters for the last 11 years in the western Caribbean.</p>
