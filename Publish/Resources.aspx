    <h2>Nautical Phrases</h2>
                <P><span class="term">A Square Meal</span> - In good weather, crews' mess was a warm meal served on square wooden platters.</P>

                <P><span class="term">Above Board</span> - Anything on or above the open deck. If something is open and in plain view, it is above board.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">As the Crow Flies</span> - When lost or unsure of their position in coastal waters, ships would release a caged crow. The crow would fly straight towards the nearest land thus giving the vessel some sort of a navigational fix. The tallest lookout platform on a ship came to be know as the crow's nest.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">At Loggerheads</span> - An iron ball attached to a long handle was a loggerhead. When heated it was used to seal the pitch in deck seams. It was sometimes a handy weapon for quarrelling crewmen.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Back and Fill</span> - A technique of tacking when the tide is with the ship but the wind is against it.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Bear Down</span> - To sail downwind rapidly towards another ship or landmark.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</span> - The devil seam was the curved seam in the deck planking closest to the side of the ship and next to the scupper gutters. If a sailor slipped on the deck, he could find himself between the devil and the deep blue sea.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Booby Hatch</span> - Aboard ship, a booby hatch is a sliding cover or hatch that must be pushed away to allow access or passage.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Buoyed Up</span> - Using a buoy to raise the bight of an anchor cable to prevent it from chafing on a rough bottom.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">By and Large</span> - Currently means in all cases or in any case. From the nautical: by meaning into the wind and large meaning with the wind: as in, "By and Large the ship handled very well."</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Chock-a-block</span> - Meaning something is filled to capacity or over loaded. If two blocks of rigging tackle were so hard together they couldn't be tightened further, it was said they were "Chock-a-Block".</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Cut and Run</span> - If a captain of a smaller ship encountered a larger enemy vessel, he might decide that discretion is the better part of valor, and so he would order the crew to cut the lashings on all the sails and run away before the wind. Other sources indicate "Cut and Run" meant to cut the anchor cable and sail off in a hurry.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Cut of His Jib</span> - Warships many times had their foresails or jib sails cut thinly so that they could maintain point and not be blown off course. Upon sighting thin foresails on a distant ship a captain might not like the cut of his jib and would then have an opportunity to escape.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Dressing Down</span> - Thin and worn sails were often treated with oil or wax to renew their effectiveness. This was called "dressing down".   An officer or sailor who was reprimanded or scolded received a dressing down.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">First Rate</span> - Implies excellence. From the 16th century on until steam powered ships took over, british naval ships were rated as to the number of heavy cannon they carried. A ship of 100 or more guns was a First Rate line-of-battle ship. Second rates carried 90 to 98 guns; Third Rates, 64 to 89 guns; Fourth Rates, 50 to 60 guns. Frigates carrying 20 to 48 guns were fifth and sixth rated.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Fly-by-Night</span> - A large sail used only for sailing downwind and requiring rather little attention.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Footloose</span> - The bottom portion of a sail is called the foot. If it is not secured, it is footloose and it dances randomly in the wind.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Garbled</span> - Garbling was the prohibited practice of mixing rubbish with the cargo. A distorted, mixed up message was said to be garbled.</P>
                
                <P><span class="term">Give (someone) a Wide Berth</span> - To anchor a ship far enough away from another ship so that they did not hit each other when they swung with the wind or tide.</P>

Coastal and low-lying escape routes flood 2-4 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Small craft in unprotected anchorages break moorings. Hurricane Bertha of 1996 was a Category Two hurricane when it hit the North Carolina coast, while Hurricane Marilyn of 1995 was a Category Two Hurricane when it passed through the Virgin Islands.</TD>

Damage to shrubbery and trees with foliage blown off trees and large tress blown down. Mobile homes and poorly constructed signs are destroyed. Low-lying escape routes are cut by rising water 3-5 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures with larger structures damaged by battering of floating debris. Terrain continuously lower than 5 ft above mean sea level may be flooded inland 8 miles (13 km) or more. Evacuation of low-lying residences with several blocks of the shoreline may be required. Hurricanes Roxanne of 1995 and Fran of 1996 were Category Three hurricanes at landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and in North Carolina, respectively.</TD>

Shrubs, trees, and all signs are blown down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Extensive damage to doors and windows. Low-lying escape routes may be cut by rising water 3-5 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Major damage to lower floors of structures near the shore. Terrain lower than 10 ft above sea level may be flooded requiring massive evacuation of residential areas as far inland as 6 miles (10 km). Hurricane Luis of 1995 was a Category Four hurricane while moving over the Leeward Islands. Hurricanes Felix and Opal of 1995 also reached Category Four status at peak intensity.</TD>

                            <TD ID=TD15>Storm surge generally greater than 18 ft above normal. Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. All shrubs, trees, and signs blown down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Severe and extensive window and door damage. Low-lying escape routes are cut by rising water 3-5 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Major damage to lower floors of all structures located less than 15 ft above sea level and within 500 yards of the shoreline. Massive evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5-10 miles (8-16 km) of the shoreline may be required. There were no Category Five hurricanes in 1995, 1996, or 1997. Hurricane Gilbert of 1988 was a Category Five hurricane at peak intensity and is the strongest Atlantic tropical cyclone of record.</TD>
